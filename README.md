Summary: analysis of comments of two Taiwanese Political Commentary YouTube Channels using topic modeling and word embedding

This is the final project of Social Media and Public Opinion Analysis at National Taiwan University in 2022. I completed it independently.

•	Managed an analysis of 340K comments from two YouTube political commentary channels using Numpy and Latent Dirichlet Allocation to extract prevalent topics; discerned distinct topical trends between channels

•	Quantified semantic relationships in YouTube comments and Wikipedia articles by training word embeddings in three corpora to extract political biases; captured anti/pro-China channel’s negative/positive biases toward China
